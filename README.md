## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

Program to calculate change.

#### Project Description
This program makes change out of the amount tendered for a product.
It is an automatic program with everything past the user input handled by learned java techniques.
It uses: 
* Objects that I make to do the calculations away from my MakeChange class allowing for a cleaner code.
* If/Else statements nested within each other helping to make decisions about the cents and dollars individually.
* Taking input from a user through the user of the Scanner object.
* I cast ints using (int) in order to go from x.00 dollar amount to x.

#### How To Run This Project
Run this through the console in eclipse or the terminal


#### Lessons Learned

I learned about how to eliminate possibilities and use the modulo '%' symbol to work through different powers in a number system. 
I also incorporated an object class I wrote and created in the if/else statement for the static method in my MakeChange class.
I am starting to be able to conceptualize a visual mental model of my program which has proven helpful in sorting through the logic 
problems like this one.
